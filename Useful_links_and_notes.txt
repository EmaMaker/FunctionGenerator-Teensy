From my current research, using the analitic formula for the sine wave in not frequency-accurate and frequency changes by changing the incremental step factor t
Where y=A*sin(wt+q)

Apparently using a lookup table is much easier, since the wave gets precomputed and stored in an array, and then it can be modulated in amplitude and frequency

But how to modulate in frequency?
Apparently phase accumulator is the answer:

And this is how you calculate the sample rate (of the DAC). Look at teensy's uC datasheet. Then just play around with it to suit your needs

Even better than using a normal lookup table, is using a lookup table that stores only a quarter of a sine wave (0 to 90Â°), and then getting the other 3/4 by simmetry
